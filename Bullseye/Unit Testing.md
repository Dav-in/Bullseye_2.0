#  Unit Testing



Test Driven Development

    + Forces up-front thought
    + ensures tests are written
    + improve code quality
    + increased speed of development
    
    
        <------------------------------------------->  

Step 1: Create the test case.

    create: 
    
        a. Setup method - Everything needed to prepare for testing
        b. Tear-down method - Anything needed after tests are complete
        c. One method for each test you want to run

Step 2: Add Asserts

    Measures what actually happened vs expected actions
    
        a. XCTAssertTrue
        b. XCTAssertEqual
        c. XCTAssertGreaterThan
        
Step 3: Run Tests
